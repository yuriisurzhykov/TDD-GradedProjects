Requirements for Fibonacci Sequence Generator Application
=========================================================

Overview
--------

This application is designed to generate Fibonacci sequences based on user input. It features an input screen where users can enter the length of the sequence they wish to generate. The application then calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to that number, displaying each item in the sequence with a delay.

Features
--------

### 1. User Input Screen

*   **Functionality**: Allows users to input the length of the Fibonacci sequence they wish to generate.
*   **Input Validation**: The application should validate the input to ensure it is a positive integer.
*   **Error Handling**: Display an error message for invalid inputs.

### 2\. Fibonacci Sequence Generation

*   **Calculation**: Implement an algorithm to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified number.
*   **Performance**: Ensure the algorithm is efficient for sequences of reasonable length (e.g., up to 50 elements).

### 3. Display of Sequence

*   **List View**: Display the Fibonacci numbers in a list view.
*   **Delayed Display**: Each item in the sequence should be displayed after a short delay (e.g., 1 second) to visually represent the sequence generation process.

### 4. User Interface

*   **Layout**: A clean and intuitive layout with a focus on usability.
*   **Responsive Design**: The application should be usable on various devices, adapting its layout to different screen sizes.

### 5\. Additional Features (Optional)

*   **Reset Functionality**: Include a reset button to clear the current sequence and allow for a new input.
*   **History**: Keep a history of generated sequences that users can view.

Technical Specifications
------------------------

### Platform

*   The application should be for android platform only.

### Programming Language

*   Feature should be implemented as an android app module using Kotlin as primary language.

### Libraries and Frameworks

*   Use standard libraries for UI components.
*   For mobile applications, native Android development.

### Testing

*   The application should be thoroughly tested, including both unit tests and UI tests.

### Accessibility

*   Ensure the application is accessible, with proper contrasts, labels, and keyboard navigation.
